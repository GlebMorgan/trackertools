Tokens:
[Node] – Symbolic name (i.e. `AB`) of the entry that the operation will be applied to
[Span] – Time interval in the format `Xh Ym` (for ex. `5h3m`, `45m`)
[Time] – Time in format `HH:MM`
[Date] – Day in one of the following formats:
         • `2022-11-06` – absolute format
         • `04` – date of specified day of the current month
         • `today` – date of the current day
         • `yesterday` – date of the previous day
         • `mon|tue|wed|thu|fri|sat|sun` – date corresponding to specified day of the week
         • `last mon|tue|wed|thu|fri|sat|sun` – date corresponding to specified day of the previous week
[Week] – Week in one of the formats:
         • `week` – monday to sunday of the current week
         • `last week` – monday to sunday of the previous week
         • `week-N` – monday to sunday of the Nth past week
[Get]  – Either of three commands: get|load|fetch
         • `get` – fetch activities and specified entries from server first time, re-load them from cache on subsequent calls
         • `load` – load activities and specified entries from cache, raise error on cache miss
         • `fetch` – download activities and specified entries from the server and update cache



Architecture:
Layer 1: API
    Gist: get time tracking data from backend server (Timeular, Timecamp, etc.)
    Input: backend credentials
    Output: python Json-like dicts with raw data from server
    Interfaces:
    • `Backend`
        • login(credentials: Dict[str, str])
        • logout()
        • get_tasks() -> Json
        • get_entries(start: date, end: date) -> Json
    Classes: `Timeular`, `Timecamp`

Layer 2: Data
    Gist: convert raw server data to `TEntry` and `TTask` objects
    Input: backend-specific Json-like dicts containing raw data from backend server
    Output: Generalized `TEntry` and `TTask` objects + `.json` cache files
    API:
        • TBA
        • TBA
        • TBA
    Interfaces:
    • `Manager`
        ...
    • `TEntry`:
        id: int
        task-id: int
        start: datetime
        end: datetime
        description: str
    • `TTask`
        id: int
        parent-id: int
        name: str
        jira: str
        spec: str
    Classes: `TimeularManager`, `TimecampManager`, `CacheManager`

Layer 3: Entities
    Classes: `Entry`, `Task`

Layer 4: Commands
    Classes: `Token`, `Command`

Layer 5: Application

Out-Layer: Export
    Classes: `Table`, `Jira`

Utils:
    Entities: `CONFIG`, `Tools`



Jira timetracking:
• Estimated = `issue.fields.timeoriginalestimate`
• Remaining = `issue.fields.timeestimate`
• Logged = `issue.fields.timespent`



Temp:
• List of numbers regex: `(((\d+(\.\d+)?)|-)(, )?)+`



ToDo:
[ ] CRITICAL: Sort items by time
[ ] HIGH: Cannot edit formatted descriptions
[ ] HIGH: Change `del XX` to `XX del` for consistency with other commands
[ ] HIGH: Looks like timezone is not applied when entry time is set manually
[ ] HIGH: Command to create new entry
[ ] HIGH: When editing formatting entry, edit original text and have option to re-format
[ ] HIGH: Save working entry list to a cache and load back (`.save()` and `.restore()` functions)
[ ] HIGH: Command `[Node] restore` for mistakenly removed nodes
[ ] MID: Jira logging via thread pool
[ ] MID: Generate aliases from the list of most easily typed combinations, like Vimium
[ ] MID: Commands `show next` and `show prev` (days)
[ ] MID: Move Timecamp and Timeular -related stuff to separate subdirectories
    (requires investigating running scripts via `python -m script.py`)
[ ] MID: Warn if span == 0 after going through `time_bounds`
[ ] MID: Resolve HTML sequences from TimeCamp like &gt;
[ ] MID: Add command or similar that will move some part of one entry to another entry: `N1 | 20m > N2`
[ ] MID: `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` handling at each `.login()` and `cls._session_.get()`
[ ] LOW: Implement all "Not implemented" commands
[ ] LOW: Use logging module for debug prints
[ ] LOW: Make sure that all the deps come only top-to-bottom (i.e. that no lower-level module imports 'app.py')
[ ] LOW: Remove or add dots in descriptions consistently
[ ] CONSIDER: Ping Jira before trying to login to allow for partial functionality without VPN
[ ] CONSIDER: Extract all fetching and caching functionality from `entry.py` to `entry-loader.py`
[ ] CONSIDER: Think about joining `[Week]` and `[Date]..[Date]` into a single Token`
[ ] CONSIDER: Remove `CONFIG` dependencies from all files except for 'app.py'
    Inject dependencies to classes directly (i.e. `Jira`, `Entry`, `Task`, etc.)
[ ] CONSIDER: Reorganize the app to handle backend dep in the most organized way possible
[ ] CONSIDER: Implement `App.get()`, should do approximately the following:
| def get(cls, start, end, validate=True):
|     try:
|         Task.load(validate)
|         Entry.load(start, end, validate)
|     except CacheMissError:
|         Server.login(CONFIG.credentials[CONFIG.backend])
|         Task.fetch(validate)
|         Entry.fetch(start, end, validate)
|         Server.logout()
[ ] CONSIDER: Implement scripting mode (commands are `eval`ed)
[ ] CONSIDER: Make `Server` and `Jira` classes a contextmanager
[ ] CONSIDER: Learn about Python protocols and use them in `ConfigLoader`
[ ] CONSIDER: Make `Backend` class in 'api.py' generic with `TypeVar`s: `BackendTask`, `BackendEntry`
[ ] CONSIDER: Add `.reload()` method to `ConfigDict` to fetch updates from source file
[ ] IDEA: Output time intervals for RND for Igoris to quickly correct:
    • Start of work – start of lunch break
    • End of lunch break – end of work
[ ] IDEA: Add undo functionality
[ ] IDEA: Automatic time logging of meetings and calls
[ ] NONE: Put config to `.toml` file and use `ConfigLoader` to parse it and wrap with `ConfigDict`

[x] Make spaces between command token and command syntax literal optional
[x] Add `Nd` format to `Span` token (does not combine with `Xh` and `Xm`, just for moving between days)
[x] Only 1 space between Jira ID and Activity name
[x] Command to replace all whitespace in entries description with a single space >> 'fix spaces'
[x] Handle multi-line entry descriptions >> replace newlines with '|'
[x] Add `Num` Token
[x] Add command to delete entries with specified activities
[x] Add 'auto_display' `CONFIG` option to display latest table automatically after every non-'show' command
[x] Move `jira_task_regex`: `CONFIG` —> `Activity`
[x] Add docstrings from "Commands" table above to command handlers in `command.py`
[x] Add `combine [Date]`, `combine [Week]` and `combine [Date]..[Date]` commands
[-] When parsing using tokens, add '\b' to the start and end of every regex string
[-] Add support for plain regexes in `Command` pattern (like r'/.*/' for arbitrary text and so on)
[-] On unhandled error, save entries to working cache
    ╰─► Resolved in a different way, just catch all exceptions in `App`
[x] Convert common MD-style formatting to Jira-style formatting (`code` to {{code}}, etc.)
[x] Check the first work in time entry description not ending with 'ing'
    If it does, suggest to use imperative form
[x] Rename `get_activities` to `get_tasks` and `Activities` to `Tasks`
[x] `[Node] [Taskname]` does not work for tasks with spaces
    Overall, will be better to specify jiraID here as well
    ╰─► Added `JiraID` token, removed `Taskname`
[-] LOW: If duration of item is < 5m, it should be removed
    ╰─► Won't do, this is not undesirable and will just loose a bit of time logged
        And `combine` command merges all small entries automatically in most cases anyway
[x] HIGH: Command to display time tracking statistics from Jira for tasks in current working set + their parents
    ╰─► Time tracking info from Jira added, not sure what is "their parents"
[-] LOW: Automatic Sprint meetings numbering
    ╰─► Won't use numbering, no reason
[x] MID: Add formatter for replacing symbols like `--`
